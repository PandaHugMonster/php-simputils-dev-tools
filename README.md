and will install it as part of dependencies.

## Installation

Minimal PHP version: **8.0**

Current toolkit version: **0.0.1** __(unstable, not released)__

**Important:** Despite the fact that this toolkit is purely CLI Tools, 
nevertheless it will follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) 
in case somebody will decide to base their development or extension of 
the functionality of this toolkit.

This toolkit is handy for **CI/CD** checks and even for **production-deployed** analysis.
So this way is **the recommended one**.

```shell
composer require spaf/simputils-dev-tools "^0"
```

### As `require-dev` dependency

```shell
composer require --dev spaf/simputils-dev-tools "^0"
